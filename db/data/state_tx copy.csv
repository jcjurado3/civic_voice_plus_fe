\ Senate District 7, which encompasses most of West Harris County. He previously\
\ served 10 years, from 1998 - 2008, as the Harris County Tax Assessor-Collector,\
\ where he introduced \u201CSmart Government\u201D at the Harris County Tax Office\
\ and developed a customer service-driven organization. His team created the first\
\ major county online property tax payment system and the first county tax office\
\ website with online vehicle registration in Texas. (His motto was \u201CGet on-line,\
\ not in-line.\u201D) He was well-known as the \u201CTax Man\u201D for his outspoken\
\ efforts to cut property taxes.\r \r In the most recent Legislative Session, Senator\
\ Bettencourt successfully passed Senate Bill 2, the Texas Property Tax Reform and\
\ Transparency Act of 2019, by a vote of 21-9 to bring meaningful property tax reform\
\ and relief to all Texas taxpayers. This was the first major property tax reform\
\ legislation in almost 40 years, and the culmination of two decades of advocacy.\
\  He also continued his work on adult stem cell therapies in Texas by sponsoring\
\ HB 3148, building upon previous legislative sessions to get  government out of\
\ the way, allowing new therapies to flourish and give terminally and chronically\
\ ill patients hope for a better quality of life.  His work during the 86th Session\
\ earned him the distinction of \""Senate MVP\"" by Capitol Inside, \""Bull of the\
\ Brazos\"" by Texas Monthly, and he was given the \""Citizen's Choice Award\"" by\
\ Empower Texans.  He has also been called an \""architect of tax relief\"" by Governor\
\ Greg Abbott. \r \r A champion for conservative solutions to Texas' challenges,\
\ Senator Bettencourt has built a strong reputation at the Capitol advocating for\
\ taxpayers.  In his previous legislative sessions he worked tirelessly to pass\
\ conservative budgets, enact a supermajority requirement within a taxing jurisdiction\
\ to raise taxes, (which prevented a $100,000,000 tax increase in its first year)\
\ as well as author SB 7 which sought to stamp out the growing plague of inappropriate\
\ student-educator relationships.  A compassionate conservative, Senator Bettencourt\
\ has been a leader on \""Right to Try\"" and adult stem cell legislation, fighting\
\ for terminally and chronically ill patients across Texas to have better access\
\ to treatments and new therapies.  Legislation that he sponsored on this important\
\ issue was adopted by the American Legislative Exchange Council as a national model\
\ other states could follow.  He has also greatly expanded dual credit opportunities\
\ (SB 1004) for Texas students and Joint-Authored bipartisan legislation to enhance\
\ educational opportunities for students through ISD/Charter partnerships (SB 1882).\
\   \r \r Numerous organizations have acknowledged Senator Bettencourt for his work\
\ in the Texas Senate.  In his first session, Capitol Inside named him \""Most Valuable\
\ Freshman\"" and Vision America named him their \""Outstanding Texas Legislator.\""\
\ He has also been named \u201CTaxpayer Advocate of the Year\u201D by the Americans\
\ for Prosperity, Previously as an elected official he was named a \u201CHero of\
\ Faith\u201D by the Houston Area Pastors\u2019 Council, and earned the \u201CPioneer\
\ Award\u201D from the Harris County Republican Party.\r \r Senator Bettencourt\
\ is the Chair of the Senate Committee on Property Tax, and serves on the Senate\
\ Finance, Education, and Higher Education committees. He also served as the Chair\
\ of the Texas Senate Republican Caucus and has been named to the Redistricting\
\ Committee by Lt. Governor Patrick.  \r \r A Bachelor of Science graduate of Texas\
\ A&M University in Industrial Distribution, Senator Bettencourt is the President\
\ and CEO of a tax consulting company in Houston that has grown to forty employees.\
\ He is also a radio and television personality.\r \r The Senator and his wife Susan\
\ are active members of Saint John Vianney Catholic Church, where Paul is a fourth\
\ degree Knight of Columbus.\r \r Senate District 7 is located in Harris County\
